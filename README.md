# Tradr

A social stock trading platform meant to make investing easier.

The platform does all of the general trading functions like searching, buying, and selling stocks, but the social part comes from having "Trending Traders". These traders are doing well right now, and other users (if these trending traders are willing) can follow their portfolio, so the users will have a portfolio that is divided between stocks the same way as the trending traders. There's also a big chatroom for traders to talk.

Another feature is the Intelligent Automatic Deposit. If the user wants, they give us their income, expenses, and bank info, and we calculate how much they can afford to put into investments each month and automatically put it into their trading account (we even put it straight into stocks if they want).


*Edit: Some features may not work as the companies are taking down their API's (this was a Hackathon project so the API's were custom for us)
